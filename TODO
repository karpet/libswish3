* add new MIME via config

* new config opt: NoBumpPositionOnTag (for inline xml tags)

* noindex comments handler

* how we will store a header-type db that is independent
  of the index proper (metanames, properties, ignorechars, etc.)
  As XML file? swish_header.xml 

* Native format: is SQL too slow? BDB? QDBM? or just use Xapian by default?

* config API (madness really)

* tokenizer: regexp lib?

* finish html parser, esp for meta, block/inline tags, word_pos logic, etc.

* StringList parse_line_into_words should support UTF8 (widechar)

* if we use Xapian, need: (1) QueryParser that uses our tokenizer and (2) property storage

* might be useful to use our own property storage regardless of IR index.
  perhaps store swish properties only in SQLite.
  KS has some preliminary support for properties.
