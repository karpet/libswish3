* add new MIME via config

* new config opt: NoBumpPositionOnTag (for inline xml tags)

* noindex comments handler

* Native format: is SQL too slow? BDB? QDBM? or just use Xapian by default?

* tokenizer: regexp lib?

* finish html parser, esp for meta, block/inline tags, word_pos logic, etc.

* StringList parse_line_into_words should support UTF8 (widechar)

* if we use Xapian, need: (1) QueryParser that uses our tokenizer and (2) property storage

* might be useful to use our own property storage regardless of IR index.
  perhaps store swish properties only in SQLite.
  KS has some preliminary support for properties.

* XMLClassAttributes is broken because end_tag() will never match
  probably need an additional parser_data->metaname flag to correlate
  and set in build_tag().
