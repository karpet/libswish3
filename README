libswish3
============================================================================
libswish3 is a document parser compatible with the Swish-e 2.4 -S prog API. 
libswish3 is a C library for parsing documents into 
a data structure that can then be stored and searched with a variety 
of IR backends.

The libswish3 model is simple: you define a handler function and pass
a pointer to that function to whichever parser input function you choose 
(in-memory, stdin, or filesystem). After each document is parsed, 
your handler function is passed the swish_ParserData object to do with 
as it pleases, most likely storing the data in an index.

See the swish_lint.c program for how you might write a handler function.


Differences from Swish-e 2.4 parser
--------------------------------------
The following Swish-e configuration options are not supported
as part of libswish3. It is up to the code that uses libswish3
to implement the features these configuration options represent.

# Delay
# EquivalentServer
# FileFilter
# FileFilterMatch
# FileMatch
# FileRules
# FileRules
# MaxDepth
# ReplaceRules
# SpiderDirectory
# TmpDir


Getting Started 
-----------------

See the INSTALL doc.

But basically:

 ./bootstrap (only necessary if you are doing development)
 ./configure
 make && make test
 sudo make install



Profiling with gprof
---------------------------

The default Makefile.am files include the -pg flag in order
to get profiling information. You should remove the -pg before
compiling for a production (i.e., non-development) system.

See the gprof man page.

Basically:

 gprof .libs/swish_lint

should give the 'make test' profile.
