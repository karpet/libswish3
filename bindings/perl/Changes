0.09 23 Oct 2010
 - change Locale test to allow for "utf8" or "UTF-8"
 - official release with cumulative fixes in the 0.08_xx series.

0.08_08 20 Oct 2010

   5.8.6 and sv_usepvn_flags() did not appear till 5.8.9.
 - dropped err.h from libswish3.c as Solaris (for one) does not seem to
   have it.

0.08_07 11 Oct 2010
 - fix (finally, I hope) the mysterious segfaults on freebsd tests. The
   problem was Perl's my_setenv() interfering with the native setenv().

   instead of sv_usepvn_mg().

0.08_06 08 Oct 2010

 - more debugging of missing locales.
