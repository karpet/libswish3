This file documents some conventions for contributing code to the project.

1. Diffs are welcome. Use 'diff -u' format.

2. Naming conventions:

    * all public functions and structs are prefixed with 'swish_'
    * all functions are lower_case_with_underscore()
    * all structs are CamelCased

3. If the function/struct is public (i.e. call-able via the library)
   then it must be documented in doc/libswish3.3.pod.

4. If the function/struct is not public, make it 'static'. If it can't be static
   (i.e., used in more than one .c file), then it is public. So prefix it with swish_
   and document it.

5. Add comments in the code per the existing examples.

6. Test cases are required. See src/test.pl for an example.
