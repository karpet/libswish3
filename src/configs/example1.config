# ----- Example 1 - limit by extension -------------
#
#  Please see the swish-e documentation for
#  information on configuration directives.
#  Documentation is included with the swish-e
#  distribution, and also can be found on-line
#  at http://swish-e.org
#
#
#  This example demonstrates how to limit
#  indexing to just .htm and .html files.
#
#---------------------------------------------------

# By default, swish creates an index file in the current directory
# called "index.swish-e" (and swish uses this name by default when
# searching.  This is convenient, but not always desired.

IndexFile /home/indexfiles/docs.index


# Although you can specify which files or directories to
# index on the command line with -i, it's common to specify
# it here.  Note that these are relative to the current directory.

# Index two directories, "docs" (below current directory) and
# "/home/otherdocs", and within those directories (and all sub
# directories) index only files ending in .html and .htm.

IndexDir docs /home/otherdocs
IndexOnly .htm .html


# If you wish to follow symbolic links use the following.
# Note that the default is "no".  I you are indexing many
# files, and you do not have any symbolic links, you may
# still want to set this to "yes".  This will avoid an extra
# lstat system call for every file while indexing.

FollowSymLinks yes


# end of example
