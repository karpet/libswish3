# ----- Example 5 - Using FileRules -------
#
#  Please see the swish-e documentation for
#  information on configuration directives.
#  Documentation is included with the swish-e
#  distribution, and also can be found on-line
#  at http://swish-e.org
#
#
#  This is a simple example of how to use FileRules
#  to limit what is indexed.
#
#---------------------------------------------------

# Include our site-wide configuration settings:

IncludeConfigFile example4.config


# Index the current directory

IndexDir .


# Now let's index only these example scripts
# It would be easier to use IndexOnly, true,
# but, this is just an example...

# Don't index the stopwords directory
FileRules pathname contains stopwords CVS

# And don't index example6.spider or any index files
FileRules filename contains .spider index.



# end of example
