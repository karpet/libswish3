# ----- Example 3 - Descriptive Index Files -------
#
#  Please see the swish-e documentation for
#  information on configuration directives.
#  Documentation is included with the swish-e
#  distribution, and also can be found on-line
#  at http://swish-e.org
#
#
#  This example demonstrates how to include
#  descriptive names to your index file
#
#---------------------------------------------------

# Define headers values for the index -- this might be
# helpful if you have a common front end program that
# reads more than one index file.  These headers can be
# returned when running swish (see the -H switch).

IndexName "Test index"
IndexDescription "This is an index of our two document directories." 
IndexPointer "http://someplace"
IndexAdmin "Doc Manager (dmanager@foo.invalid)"



# From previous examples:

# What to index
IndexFile /home/indexfiles/docs.index
IndexDir docs /home/otherdocs
IndexOnly .htm .html
FollowSymLinks yes

# Index meta tags
MetaNames author description
UndefinedMetaNames ignore


# end of example
