# ----- Example 7 - Spider using "http" method -------
#
#  Please see the swish-e documentation for
#  information on configuration directives.
#  Documentation is included with the swish-e
#  distribution, and also can be found on-line
#  at http://swish-e.org
#
#
#  This example demonstrates how to use the
#  the "http" method of spidering.
#
#  Indexing (spidering) is started with the following
#  command issued from the "conf" directory:
#
#     swish-e -S http -c example7.config
#
#  Note: You should have the current Bundle::LWP bundle
#  of perl modules installed.  This was tested with:
#     libwww-perl-5.53
#
#  ** Do not spider a web server without permission **
#
#---------------------------------------------------

# Include our site-wide configuration settings:

IncludeConfigFile example4.config

# Specify the URL (or URLs) to index:
IndexDir http://swish-e.org


# If a server goes by more than one name you can use this directive:

EquivalentServer http://swish-e.org  http://www.swish-e.org



# This defines how many links the spider should
# follow before stopping.  A value of 0 configures the spider to
# traverse all links. The default is 5
# The idea is to limit spidering, but seems of questionable use
# since depth may not be related to anything useful.

MaxDepth 10

# The number of seconds to wait between issuing
# requests to a server.  The default is 60 seconds.

Delay 1


# (default /var/tmp)  The location of a writeable temp directory
# on your system.  The HTTP access method tells the Perl helper to place
# its files there.  The default is defined in src/config.h and depends on
# the current OS.

TmpDir .


# The "http" method uses a perl helper program to fetch each document
# from the web called "swishspider" and is included in the src directory of
# the swish-e distribution.
SpiderDirectory ../src


# end of example
