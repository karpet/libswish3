    * turn SWISH_PARSER_WARNINGS on by default, rather than off. This effectively
      "re-throws" libxml2 parser warnings and errors via SWISH_WARN(). Turn it off
      by setting SWISH_PARSER_WARNINGS=0 env variable.

2010-02-07
    * rename reset_bool_flags() to reset_headmaker() in header.c and fix case
      where illegal placed text in a config file could case the parser to segfault.
    * xmlns support added for config files.

    * changed default Property->sort flag to SWISH_TRUE to match 2.x behavior.

    * added binmode flag to the io_slurp* functions. The default is false,
      which will remove all NUL bytes from the buffer after slurping.

    * added swish_string_to_boolean() function
    * added documentation to libswish3 about reserved Configuration
      Directive names
