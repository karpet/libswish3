    * quieted gcc 4.x warning for libxml2 xmlParserError() calls.
 
2010-05-09
    * new Makefile targets for building a single libswish3.c file
      This new feature is used by the bindings/perl SWISH::3 module
      to bundle the libswish3.c and libswish3.h files with the CPAN
      distribution, to make it easier to install (no external dependency).

2010-05-05
    * add new debug var SWISH_DEBUG_IO and use it in io.c.
    * SWISH::3 perl bindings now detect .gz extension and transparently
      decompress like swish_lint et al do.
    * swish_io_slurp_gzfile_len() signature changed. It now takes a pointer
      to the original file length, which will be updated to the actual buffer
      length post-decompress.

2010-04-05
    * fix bug where bump_word was being applied too aggressively.

2010-02-16
    * turn SWISH_PARSER_WARNINGS on by default, rather than off. This effectively
      "re-throws" libxml2 parser warnings and errors via SWISH_WARN(). Turn it off
      by setting SWISH_PARSER_WARNINGS=0 env variable.
    * fix bug in utf8 tokenizer where lowercase version of string is different
      byte length than uppercase version.
    * standardize (and document) libswish3 handling of document encodings.

2010-02-07
    * rename reset_bool_flags() to reset_headmaker() in header.c and fix case
      where illegal placed text in a config file could case the parser to segfault.
    * xmlns support added for config files.

2010-01-05
    * changed default Property->sort flag to SWISH_TRUE to match 2.x behavior.

2009-12-15
    * added binmode flag to the io_slurp* functions. The default is false,
      which will remove all NUL bytes from the buffer after slurping.

2009-12-04
    * added swish_string_to_boolean() function
    * added documentation to libswish3 about reserved Configuration
      Directive names

2009-10-17
    * zlib now required.
    * added transparent .gz file decompression via swish_io_slurp_gzfile_len()
    * changed signature for swish_io_slurp_file()
    * added is_gzipped flag to docinfo struct

2009-10-12
    * added --Facets, --begin and --max options to swish_xapian

2009-10-08
    * daily builds available at http://swish-e.org/devel/daily.html
    * added multiple-value sorting to swish_xapian, supporting functions in swish_StringList space
